make tables for { driver rider cab trip location }
create relationship between 2 tables

Conditions:
	drivers >= cabs
	boolean addDriver if 1 then insert, if 0 then delete
	boolean acceptTrip if 1 then insert, if 0 then delete
	boolean autoApproval if 1 then addDriver = 1, if 0 then addDriver = 0
Graph  - Locations/NodePoints:
	weights = distance
	cost = weight * base_rate
	Keys: Array of elements
	Values: Linked List
	triangular inequality: d(v) < d(u) + w(u,v)
		You add a new edge (u,v), you need to check if the triangular inequality holds:
		d(v) < d(u) + w(u,v)
		If it does, there is no new shortest path.
		Otherwise, you have a new shortest path from the source (A) to v, which invalidates all shortest paths with weight greater than the new d(v).

use switch case, try catch finally, assert, constants for repititive string
comparator sorting for taxi allocation priority 
first 5 kms fixed 100 Rs further for each 5 kms costs+= 10 Rs [5:100, 10:110, 15:120, 20]

Design a Call taxi booking application

-There are n number of taxi’s. For simplicity, assume 4. But it should work for any number of taxi’s.

-The are 6 points(A,B,C,D,E,F)

-All the points are in a straight line, and each point is 15kms away from the adjacent points.

-It takes 60 mins to travel from one point to another

-Each taxi charges Rs.100 minimum for the first 5 kilometers and Rs.10 for the subsequent kilometers.

-For simplicity, time can be entered as absolute time. Eg: 9hrs, 15hrs etc.

-All taxi’s are initially stationed at A.

-When a customer books a Taxi, a free taxi at that point is allocated

-If no free taxi is available at that point, a free taxi at the nearest point is allocated.

-If two taxi’s are free at the same point, one with lower earning is allocated

-Note that the taxi only charges the customer from the pickup point to the drop point. Not the distance it travels from an adjacent point to pickup the customer.

-If no taxi is free at that time, booking is rejected

		cancel: if no bookings, return 
		booking: if no cabs, move to waiting
		booking: if no cabs, and cabs in leave, cancel booking
