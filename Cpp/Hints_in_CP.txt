ARRAYS:
    Reversing an array:
        Techniques:
            Kadane's algorithm
            Two pointers
        Changes
            Indices of elements change
        Constant
            Array Sum
            Sum of every pair of adjacent elements  
        Properties:
            For an array to have zero as its bitwise AND, at least one of the elements must have offbit
    Sorted array:
        Techniques:
            Binary Search
        Properties:
            in Two pointers Sum for finding a pair (x, y) that sums to z, moving head pointer forward increases the sum and moving tail pointer backward decreases sum 
    Circular array:
        Techniques:
            Look out for modulo properties

Stacks:
    Pushing and Popping:
        Techniques:
            Balancing Parentheses
            Infix to Postfix Conversion
            Evaluation of Expressions
        Properties:
            Operations are usually dependent on the (previous) last element in the array
