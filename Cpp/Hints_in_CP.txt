ARRAYS:
    Reversing an array:
        Techniques:
            Kadane's algorithm
            Two pointers
        Changes
            Indices of elements change
        Constant
            Array Sum
            Sum of every pair of adjacent elements  
        Properties:
            
    Sorted array:
        Techniques:
            Binary Search
        Properties:
            in Two pointers Sum for finding a pair (x, y) that sums to z, moving head pointer forward increases the sum and moving tail pointer backward decreases sum 
    Circular array:
        Techniques:
            Look for modulo properties
